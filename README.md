# Volatile
#### Volatile: your day-to-day trading companion.

The word "volatile" comes from Latin *volatilis*, meaning "having wings" or "able to fly". With time, its connotation embraced "lively" or "flickle", until the financial market tightened its meaning to “subject to rapid or unexpected change” as a behavioural description of stocks in the market. Here and now, we endow the term Volatile with the additional meaning of "trading companion", hoping it will be able to guide you every day towards unemotional, algorithmic-based, trading decisions.

If you expect Volatile to predict the unpredictable, you are in the wrong place. Be reasonable: this is a single-trader targeted software aimed to quickly discover swing trading opportunities by comparing current stock prices to their projections in a few days. If the current price is much lower than its future projection, perhaps it is a good opportunity to buy, vice versa to sell. This does neither mean the projection will be necessarily met, nor that you will make a short-term profit for every single transition you make. Anything could happen. However, running Volatile on a daily basis will put you in condition to very quickly survey the market, find good opportunities and base your trading decisions on models, algorithms and data.
